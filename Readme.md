# Employee Management API

Backend API built using Go and PostgreSQL.

This project is a take-home assignment focused on building a production-ready,
API-only backend with authentication, employee management, and salary metrics.

## Tech Stack
- Go
- PostgreSQL
- JWT Authentication

## API Versioning

All APIs will be exposed under a versioned base path.

Current version:
- v1 → `/api/v1`

This allows future iterations without breaking existing clients.
